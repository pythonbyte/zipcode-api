# API documentation

This API works with 3 simple endpoints:

## Call Start Endpoint
This endpoint works at the **/call/** , the parameters needed to send to create a Call Start is 'call_id', 'source', 'destination' and 'timestamp'. The 'id' and 'record_type' fields are automatically generated.
Besides that the source and destination number will only accept 10 or 11 numbers.

Post data:
```
{
    "call_id": 1,
    "source": "99778855443",
    "destination": "9988221132",
    "timestamp": "2018-02-28T21:57:13Z"
}
```
Response data:
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "call_id": 1,
    "record_type": "start",
    "source": "99778855443",
    "destination": "9988221132",
    "timestamp": "2018-02-28T21:57:13Z"
}
```
## Call End Endpoint
This endpoint works at the **/callend/** , the parameters needed to send to create a Call End is 'call_id' and 'timestamp'. The 'id' and 'record_type' fields are automatically generated.

Post data:
```
{
    "call_id": 1,
    "timestamp": "2018-02-28T22:57:13Z"
}
```
Response data:
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "record_type": "end",
    "call_id": 1,
    "timestamp": "2018-02-28T22:57:13Z"
}
```
The call records are automatically created after a call_start id matches a call_end id.

## Phone Bill Endpoint
This endpoint works at the **/bills/** , the only parameter required is 'subscriber' and you can set 'period' with format 'mm/YYYY' to search for a period of bills for that subscriber. If the period parameter is not sent, the API will return the last closed month bill.


Post data:
```
{
    "subscriber": "99988526423",
    "period": "02/2016"
}
```
Works as - /bills/?subscriber=99988526423&period=02/2016

Response data:
```
{
    "subscriber": "99988526423",
    "period": "2/2016",
    "total": "R$ 11,16",
    "bills": [
        {
            "destination": "9993468278",
            "start_date": "2016-02-29",
            "start_time": "12:00:00",
            "duration": "2:00:00",
            "price": "R$ 11,16"
        }
    ]
}
```
